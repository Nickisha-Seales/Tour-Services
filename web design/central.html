          Botanical Garden (St Vincent)
		Located on 20 acres of land on the outskirts of the capital Kingstown, the Botanic Gardens are the oldest of their kind in the Western Hemisphere. 
		Among the wide variety of tropical trees and shrubs is a breadfruit tree from the original plant brought to the country by Captain Bligh (of The Bounty fame) in 1793. 
		Conservation of rare species of plants has been practised since the Gardens were founded in 1765. Other conservation works involve the national bird, the St Vincent Parrot (Amazona Guildingii). 
		Facilities offered here are washrooms, a small performance area, gazebos, refreshment and craft sales. The Gardens are a popular spot for wedding ceremonies.

         Fort Charlotte 
Fort Charlotte, located just west of Kingstown, Saint Vincent, is a historic British-colonial era fort built between 1763 and 1806. 
Perched approximately 600 feet above sea level, it was originally constructed to defend against French attacks, Carib unrest, and slave rebellions. 
The fort could accommodate around 600 troops and was equipped with over 30 cannons, many of which were strategically pointed inland to guard against land-based threats. 
Today, visitors can explore the remaining structures and enjoy panoramic views of Kingstown, the Grenadines, and the surrounding Caribbean Sea.
