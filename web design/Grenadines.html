          Princess Margaret Beach
A short walk from Port Elizabeth, the bustling heart of Bequia, lies Princess Margaret Beach—a tranquil stretch of golden sand named after Princess Margaret, who famously swam there during a visit in the 1950s. 
Nestled in Admiralty Bay, this beach is popular yet peaceful, offering excellent swimming conditions, crystal-clear waters, and a laid-back atmosphere. You can enjoy snorkeling near the rocks, dine at the beachfront Jack’s Bar, or take the scenic Belmont Walkway for beautiful views of the coast. 
It’s a perfect mix of natural beauty and accessibility.

         Salt Whistle Bay 
		 Located on the tranquil island of Mayreau, the smallest inhabited island in the Grenadines, Salt Whistle Bay is a postcard-perfect destination known for its calm turquoise waters, soft white sand, and sheltered anchorage that draws yachts from around the world. 
		 The bay is ideal for swimming, snorkeling, and sunset watching, with nearby beach bars and local vendors offering a taste of island life. 
		 The natural curve of the beach is lined with palm trees and separated from the rough Atlantic side by a narrow strip of land, making it one of the most unique and scenic spots in the Grenadines.

          Discover the Hidden Gem of Tobago Cay
For a truly unforgettable adventure in St. Vincent, set your sights on Fort Duvernette, a historic fortress dramatically perched atop a towering 195-foot volcanic rock just off the southern coast. 
Accessible only by a short boat ride from the Young Island dock, this one-of-a-kind site offers both history and breathtaking scenery. 
Climb the 255 stone steps to the summit and be rewarded with panoramic views of the Caribbean Sea, Young Island, and the surrounding coastline. 
Originally built in the 1790s to protect the nearby Calliaqua Bay, Fort Duvernette still holds remnants of its old cannons and colonial charm. 
Whether you're a history enthusiast, a nature lover, or just looking for an off-the-beaten-path experience, Fort Duvernette is a must-visit treasure that perfectly blends culture, adventure, and stunning views.
