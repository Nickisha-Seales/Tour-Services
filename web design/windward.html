        <p>
       Black Point Tunnel, also known as Jasper Rock Tunnel, is a historic site located on the eastern coast of Saint Vincent, near Byera Hill. 
	   Constructed between 1812 and 1815 by the British using enslaved African labor, the approximately 300-foot-long tunnel was designed to facilitate the transportation of sugar from inland plantations to coastal ships for export. This engineering feat involved manually cutting through volcanic rock using basic tools. 
	   The tunnel is part of the Black Point Heritage and Recreational Park, which offers visitors amenities such as gazebos, washrooms, and barbecue pits. 
	   Notably, the site served as a filming location for the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl." Located approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Kingstown, reaching Black Point Tunnel by taxi typically takes about an hour, depending on traffic.
