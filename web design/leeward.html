          Vermont Nature Trail
Cutting a path through the Grand Bonhomme Mountain in the south of St Vincent, the Vermont Nature Trail is an excellent spot for both hiking and nature watching. 
The trail consists of a network of loops on the mountain, which go through both evergreen and tropical rainforests. 
Some of the island’s dense vegetation and meandering streams are on full display and hikers may be able to spot some of the island’s bird species like the endangered St Vincent Parrot.
Thanks to St. Vincent’s wealth of inland waterfalls, hikers can enjoy rewards of a different kind at the end of their trails. 
Trinity Falls, sitting at about a 30-minute hike into the forest, features three separate cascades, 40 ft. in total, flowing into a serene circular swimming pool before another 10 ft. drop into a second natural spot for a swim.

         Discover the Mystery of Gorilla Rock

Tucked away along the rugged coastline of St. Vincent, Gorilla Rock is a natural wonder that sparks curiosity and amazement. 
This striking rock formation, shaped uncannily like a gorilla’s head, rises majestically from the sea, its powerful profile carved by centuries of wind and waves. 
Whether viewed from a passing boat or a scenic cliffside vantage point, it’s a perfect photo opportunity and a must see, for nature lovers and adventurers. 
Legends swirl around its origin, adding a touch of local folklore to the experience. 
A visit to Gorilla Rock is not just about sightseeing, it’s about feeling the magic and mystery of the Caribbean's wild beauty.

Nestled on the lush leeward side of St. Vincent, Dark View Falls is a stunning natural attraction featuring two cascading waterfalls, one above the other, fed by the rich forested slopes of the La Soufrière volcano.
